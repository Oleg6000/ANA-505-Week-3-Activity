# This code chunk would identify my working directory and set it to where I want to save and fetch files

# This brings the 'Titanic' data into my environment from Base R and I "Run" thi line to action this.
data(Titanic)
# This code saves the Titanic data as a dataframe with a new name with reference to my name as suggested.
OlegTitanic <- as.data.frame(Titanic)
# This code chunk allows me to see the top 2 rows of my data
head(OlegTitanic, 2)
# This code chunk shows me the internal structure
str(OlegTitanic)
# This code chunk shows me some basic summary stats
summary(OlegTitanic)
# This allows me to save one column as its own object ('values' in the Environment)
# The Titanic dataset consists of variables Class, Sex, Age, Survived, Freq
# Let's save 'Sex' and 'Age' as objects
Sex <- OlegTitanic$Sex
Age <- OlegTitanic$Age
# This takes the individual objects ('values' in the Environment) and creates a dataframe
SexAgeDF <- data.frame(Sex, Age)
# This code chunk creates a subset from my dataset
subset_freq_gt_25 <- subset(OlegTitanic, Freq > 25)
# This shows me how many rows are in my dataset
nrow(OlegTitanic)
# This shows me how many columns are in my dataset
ncol(OlegTitanic)
# This also shows me how many rows and columns with just one command
dim(OlegTitanic)
# This code will install the ggplot2 package after I "Run" this line in R

# This code calls the ggplot2 package so I can use its functions after I "Run" this line in R
library(ggplot2)
# This code creates a bar chart of the number of passengers that survived and did not survive
# with 'Survived' on x-axis and 'Freq' on y-axis. I can now see the plot in the right pane of R Studio.
ggplot(OlegTitanic, aes(Survived, Freq)) + geom_col()
# this completes Week 3 assignment in ANA 505 course.
